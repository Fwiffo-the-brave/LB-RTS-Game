# LB-RTS-Game
An attempt to try and remake a classic DS game using godot 4
Current Goal is to make a RTS game with multiplayer which is simple like the lego battles games and features similar gameplay.

Currently the basic multiplayer lobby system works, and some stuff like movement and damage sync correctly. Buildings mostly work as expected, but the AI is not capable of playing yet and most units do not actually exist in any meaningful way. Combat still needs a lot of work. Workers are able to gather trees, build buildings, and repair them.
